> Exact Matching of Attractive Shared rides (ExMAS) for system-wide strategic evaluations
---

ExMAS allows you to match trips into attractive shared rides.

For a given:
* network (`osmnx` graph), 
* demand (microscopic set of trips $q_i = (o_i, d_i, t_i)$)
* parameters (behavioural, like _willingness-to-share_ and system like _discount_ for shared rides)

It computes:
* optimal set of shared rides (results of bipartite matching with a given objective)
* shareability graph
* set of all feasible rides
* KPIs of sharing
* trip sharing attributes 

ExMAS is a `python` based open-source package applicable to general networks and demand patterns.
